When i called in a state of panic, my representative made it better and helped lead me to a solution that solved my problem...even though it wasn't even a Rebilia issue. I'm so thankful. Thank you Rebilia! Nadia",

The Rebillia team is extremely knowledgeable and are always eager to come up with solutions for some of our unique challenges. The customer service is top-notch! We almost always get answers to our questions immediately. Our team couldnâ€™t be happier with this product and we're looking forward to future versions of the software",

        "We have been with Rebillia since March '18. Our relationship has been extensive. Specifically, Matt, et al. have been able to help us implement Big Commerce optimized checkout, taught us about reMail campaigns, and provided support on all things related to the checkout process. We have a great history with this company. The pricing is transaction based and grows with the use of the product, so you pay for what you use - a fair approach for B2B marketing. The reporting includes revenue generation and the expense matches a monthly revenue cycle so you can always easily verify a positive ROI. We would definitely recommend this app and service to businesses of all sizes.",

        "Our Farm during Covid-19 was fortunate enough to be shipping produce boxes to many in need that didn't want to leave their houses. Rebillia was there every step of the way. We will have our best year yet, with the help of Rebillia. We are looking forward to the subtle improvements coming soon, and the continued integration support that we expect from Bigcommerce platform. Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually subscriptions. The crew on tech support and setup are great at helping with the simple or the most complex issues. We hope to continue our partnership with Rebillia in 2021! If your thinking about subscriptions on your storefront, THIS is the one to get.",
